const masterMessageText = `A degree for an advanced builder. These builders are very strong fundamentally, and can create solid bases
> To earn this degree, submit your best base via a Sanctuary or Rusticated code and optionally a YouTube link of a tour.

**Rules**
- You are allowed to receive feedback from other Bachelor degree and under builders. However, you can not receive any solutions.
- The base must be your own, copying other builders is not allowed.
- Breaking these rules will invalidate any attempts at this degree, and increase the cooldown between resubmits.

*You can find the criteria for Master's [here](<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PQn2MLCoLu0ZRvAenMfkeoRWUOnmrdmLub0Koz_r2pI>)*`;
